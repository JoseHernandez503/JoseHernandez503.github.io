* Lab 4 - Part 2

  Lab 04 part 2 is one of my favorite labs that I have worked on this semester. This is 
  because I was able to convert decimal measurements into feet and inches by making a program 
  that would do all the math. This was also the first time using “Truncated”, this experience 
  helped with other projects in the future since the truncated function helps by finding the 
  nearest whole number.


* Lab 03 - part 2 

  This is also one of my favorite labs because in this lab we learned how to use the commands 
  from the terminal as arguments in the code. I personally liked this part of the lab because 
  I got to make a code to basically put together a code that prints out a sandwich order. 
  This was a fun activity to learn how to use std::cin and std::cout in our code.


* Lab 07 - part 2

  This was a very interesting lab, which makes it one of my favorites. Working in this lab 
  was a bit hard at first because we had to input a formula into the code and it was easy to 
  mess up on it. I had always wondered how a computer can calculate my age, but this lab 
  surprised me because with the end result I was able to calculate how many days have passed 
  since the day I was born.
